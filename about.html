                        Till my 3rd year of college, I expanded my technical skills by diving into multiple programming languages and web technologies, including Java, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through hands-on projects, I strengthened my understanding of object-oriented programming with Java and C++, while also exploring the world of web development by creating interactive and visually appealing websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This year has been pivotal in shaping my coding abilities and preparing me for more advanced challenges in the tech field.
